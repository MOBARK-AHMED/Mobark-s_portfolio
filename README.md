Project 1: Investigate a dataset called TMDb movie data.
I was provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. I used statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report my conclusions and recommendations in a report. In this project, I choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.I complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing the findings.
